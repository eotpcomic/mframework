MFramework is a library for creating safe tasks, queues and other useful things for the esp32, in c ++.

Many of the standard STL containers are replaced with their own optimized versions. Recognizable by its own namespace mofw.
All containers, such as vector, list, queue, rb-tree  can be found in the namespace mofw::container.

Various types of association classes are provided for simplicity. This is just the exchange of the used allocator from the system to the Spiram allocator, whereby certain regions can be swapped out to a different storage capacity without having to rewrite the entire program.
Certain allocation in addition to a limit, the bytes used to be limited.
All allocator find you under the namespace mofw::memory.

The containers and pointers use as default the mofw::memory::default_allocator_t.

For network programming see mofw::net. (net/mn_socket.hpp) they contains a asy to use network socket wrapper for lwip,
IPv4 and IPv6 support. Currently only dgram_socket_ip{4,6} and  stream_socket_ip{4,6} support, raw socket are follow in version 2.30, with class for wifi AP and Wifi STA support

For tickhooks please activated CONFIG_FREERTOS_LEGACY_HOOKS in your sdkconfig !!

## Using
Build from git from
1. ```sh ./configure or ./configure --prefix=<path> # without prefix then install to /opt```
2. ```sh make build ```
3. ```sh sudo or doas make install ```
4. ```add  "lib_deps = /opt/mtSTL/mtSTL-2.*.tar.gz"  to your platformio.ini```

### Example
```ini
[env:esp-wrover-kit]
platform = espressif32
board = esp-wrover-kit
framework = espidf
lib_deps = /opt/mtSTL/mtSTL-2.*.tar.gz

```
## Using from platformio
```ini
# platformio.ini â€“ project configuration file

[env:my_build_env]
platform = espressif32
framework = espidf
lib_deps =
  # RECOMMENDED
